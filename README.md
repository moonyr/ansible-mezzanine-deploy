# Mezzanine Example (Ansible)

This repository contains a **simplified Ansible playbook** to install and set up a Mezzanine project on Debian.  
Itâ€™s meant for **learning Ansible automation**, not for production use.

Run the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/virtmanager.ini mezzanine.yml
